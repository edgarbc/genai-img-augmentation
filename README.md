Deep learning has proven to be an effective method to improve condition identification in healthcare using x-ray images [1]. However, developing deep learning models can be difficult because accessing appropriate training datasets can be complicated due to high costs of expert labeling or privacy restrictions due sensitive patient information [2]. Generative AI has the potential to overcome these limitations by producing synthetic medical images that closely resemble real patient data [3]. In this project I review some generative AI models that have been used to generate images and explain how one of them, diffusion models, can augment an x-ray dataset using Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) platform.

This repository is part of a [medium blog](https://medium.com/@viajesubmarino/synthetic-x-ray-dataset-augmentation-using-generative-ai-178ebc15a074) post I wrote about using Generative AI to augment panoramic xrays datasets with monai. 

# Code

I adapted a tutorial from MONAI to train a variational autoencoder to generate panoramic xrays:
